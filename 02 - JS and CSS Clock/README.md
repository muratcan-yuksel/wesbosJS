<h3>My approach</h3>
<ul>
<li> I know that I learn nothing by coding along </li>
<li>So I watched the video</li>
<li> Took notes</li>
<li>Tried to implement it myself</li>
</ul>
<h3>What did I learn?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I never had the chance to use the getDate, getMinutes, getSeconds, getHours methods. So that was cool</li>
<li>I didn't know how to make a circle with CSS. It wasn't difficult, was it? </li>
<li>transform thingy is cool. But complicated</li>
</ul>
